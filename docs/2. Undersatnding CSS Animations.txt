2.1 Animation basics
======================

For any CSS keyframe animation you create you have to: 
- define the animation (tell CSS what it is that should happen) 
- assign that animation to a specific element or elements in your HTML

The @keyframe block - @keyframe rule
Keyframes are a list describing everything that should happen over the course of the animation: define the values for the animating properties at various points during the animation and any property that you'd like to see change over the course of one's cycle of an animation needs to be listed in your keyframes. 

There are a few options available to us for how we can define each keyframe within our @keyframe rule.

---

@keyframe *name* {
from { *start*; }
to { *end*; }

The element should have:
animation-name: *the defined name of the keyframe*;
animation-duration: *time of the animation*;
animation-timing-function: *how will behave in the time set*;
(have a default value)
animation-iteration-count: *how many times the animation will play*;
(have a default value)

================================================
2.2 Use animation-delay and animation-fill-mode
================================================

The animation-delay is the time will wait before the animation executes.
The animation-fill-mode will fill with what to do outside the actual duration of its animation and have four values: none, backwards, forwards and both.

Keyframes are defined (from to) and also in percentages.

=============================
2.3 Use animation-direction
=============================

Animation-direction let's us manipulate what order our keyframes are executed in:
- normal - 
All iterations of the animation are played as specified. Keyframes play from start to end.
- reverse - 
All iterations of the animation are played in the reverse direction. Keyframes play end to start.
- alternate - 
The animation direction is alternated with each iteraction of the animation. Keyframes play from start to end, then end to start, and continue alternating. 
- alternate-reverse -
The animation direction is alternated with each iteraction of the animation. Keyframes play from end to start, then start to end, and continue alternating.

================================
2.4 Timing functions and easing
================================

The easing you choose has the power to greatly effect the way your animation comes across.

Easing is the way speed is distrbuted across the duration of our animation.

Predifined keywords:
- ease: similar to ease-in-out
- linear: same constant speed
- ease-in: start slow
- ease-out: start quick
- ease-in-out: top speed at the middle of the animation
