1.1 CSS Transform Basics
=========================

CSS Transforms 
- change the shape and position of the affectes content by modifying the coordinate space
- do not disrupt the normal document flow

Translate uses % but if we use this it takes % of is own width.

Transforms also have a stacking order, which means the order you apply each transformation in will affect how the overall effect looks.
