1.1 CSS Transform Basics
=========================

CSS Transforms 
- change the shape and position of the affectes content by modifying the coordinate space
- do not disrupt the normal document flow

Translate uses % but if we use this it takes % of is own width.

Transforms also have a stacking order, which means the order you apply each transformation in will affect how the overall effect looks.

1.2 Simple 3D Transforms
=========================

Getting into 3D in CSS can be a simple as rotating something around the X or Y-axis.

Two places to add perspective:
- in the transform rule itself
- the parent element

Perspective length can be set:
- pixels 
- ems 

Represents the approximate distance of how far away you are from that transforming element. 
- Lower values show more drastic effect 
- Higher values show a flatter effect.

Move 3d
transform: translate3d(x-axis,y-axis,z-axis)

z-axis 
- high numbers - closer
- low numbers - far

1.3 CSS transitions
=====================

Transitions are one of the ways we can create animation with CSS.

In the file we are going to see a button that transition on hover. 

Transitions can be: 
- set separatly
transition: background 0.5s ease-in, transform 0.5s ease-in-out;
- be delayed (second number is the delay)
transition: background 0.5s ease-in, transform 0.5s 0.25s ease-in-out;
